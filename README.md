# Data-Structure
This repository contains all the basic data structure learnt during the semester as a core subject.
* **LinkList** : This folder contains the programs based on 3 types of linked list such as singly linked list, doubly linked list, circularly linked list 
                  in which operations such as insertion & deletion of elements and some more.
* **stack** : This folder contains the programs based on stack in which 2 stacks are implemented using single Array.
* **Queue** : This folder contains the programs based on circular queue in which operations such as enqueue and dequeue of elements.
* **Binary Tree** : This folder contains the programs based on binary tree & skew tree and performs the operations such as insertion, deletion and also finding the max depth of the tree.
* **Binary Search Tree** : This folder contains the programs based on Binary search tree such as some basic insertion & deletion and many more advanced operations.
* **AVL Tree** : This folder contains the programs based on AVL tree in which operations are performed such as insertion and deletion of elements.
* **Hashing** : This folder contains the programs based on Hashing in which hashing is performed based on two ways such as linear probing and separate chaining.
* **Recursion** : This folder contains the programs based on Recursion which includes some basic recursive problems.
* **Sorting** : This folder contains the programs based on sorting in which sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Heap sort is used.                 

_**Note**_: All these programs are written using the _C language_.
